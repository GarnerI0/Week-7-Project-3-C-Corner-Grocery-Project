# Week-7-Project-3-C-Corner-Grocery-Project

This project was assigned by Professor Gregori in Week 7 of CS-210 to help Corner Grocery find which items sold well, which items were not selling, and to make it easier to keep inventory, I believe I fool proofed the program by making it create a backup file to help the owner if any mistakes or errors were made during the creation or input process, I do not believe there is anyway I could improve my code but I look forward to hearing back in my grade! I found the header files to be a bit challenging but after I got over it it was easy!
